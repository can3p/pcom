# Private communities, manifesto

Most of the popular platforms are heavily biased in favor of public outreach.
Eventhough that's a good way to create a marketplace and sell ads, the model
results in very particular user behavior where self promotion and shock content
turn out to work the best. In addition to that the public nature of the
platforms makes users vulnurable to hate storms and trolling.

The other omnipresent feature of the platforms is a programmatic infinite feed
of updates which boosts pageviews and makes the platform addictive.  The reason
for this model lies in vc funding and corporate structure which requires every
growing profits.

In the very beginning all social networks started as a way to get updates from
your friends and relatives and to discover people which you like to read and
possible want to get connected offline.

Why don't we return to this idea taking into account some lessons learnt?

## Funding

The best way to avoid distortion by vc is to exclude vcs from the ecuation.
The platform should be worked on non-profit basis and any monetisation should
never be a function of pageviews/reads.

One reason to require a lot of funding is to support highly popular users
which have millions of followers and consequently require a lot of resources
from platform. Popular users also skew the platform towards self promotion.

If there is no focus on pageviews, we can also design a platform to be
a bad platform to become an influencer.

## Idea

We can make a stripped down version of livejournal (no communities, no custom
styles) with a focus on privacy of interaction and human touch.

What we want to attempt to get back is every day journals and personal notes.

Here is an outline:

* Human to human.

  Connections are reciprocal (like linkedin), they cannot be made blindly (not
  like linkedin).

  - There is no signup, a user should be invited

    Real users should invite real users. A user should vouch for new invitees
    with their account

  - If there is no common friend, a user should whitelist another one in order
    for them to issue a connection request.

    Random people will not be able to bother you

  - If there is a common connection, a user can ask it to mediate the connection
    request and do an introduction

* Friends as a discovery mechanic

  There is no common feed to read, there is no rating, no nothing. Since a user
  had been invited by another one, their feed will start with the posts from that
  user exclusively.

  The default feed for given user will only show the content from direct connections.
  The discovery can be done by checking the comments (connections of connections)
  and reading the posts from connections of connections in case they allow that.

  It's completely ok to be done with all new posts for the day, no infinite feeds.

* Long form

  The focus will be on the longer type of texts. You can do quick short posts but
  the platform should discourage or group that to limit the noise.

  Text content is markdown with images and possibly embeds github style.

  There is no need to keep it that way forever, we new post types may be allowed

  Comments are threaded, emotions for posts are available (not for comments)

* Completely open

  Since there is no focus on pageviews and monetisation, there is no reason to hold
  to content either, which means

  - Opensource implementation in case somebody wants to launch a separate instance

    This does not mean any sort of federation.

  - Full import/export
  - Per user API, no way to crawl the graph.

* Community responsibility

  Every user is responsible for the people they've invited. If you invitee
  starts posting crazy stuff you need to handle that. If a lot of people flag
  the content of your invitee, you need to handle that.

  - A user can revoke the invite and unless another existing user picks up the
    torch, the journal will be suspended.
  - A user that flags/revokes too many invites is penalised. A flag requires
    an explanation.
  - If you simply don't like the content - do not flag it, just mute it

## That's it!
