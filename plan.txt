pcom plans

A Text file works for hobby projects just fine

* Add RSS to explore feed
* Allow to follow users. That should be the same as subscribing to an RSS feed.
* Allow to set fields via url like `/write?title=nice title&body=this post is cool` for new posts. The page should get the field filled in and save the draft + update url right away in this case
* On a single post page in case of url posts render all the posts from connections or public posts that are linked to the same url
* By default all rss items are only visible to the subscriber. They can dismiss rss items to remove them from feed
* It's possible to convert any rss item into a url-post
* If somebody from connections has written a url-post about an item from the feed, show url post only with a remark that the user has this url in the feed as well
* User can set the visibility for their subscriptions, same as posts
* Images from rss feeds should be proxied via pcom
