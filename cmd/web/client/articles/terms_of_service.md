## Intro

This service is run on volunteer basis and that means that all you
see was done for free just for the fun of it. And since it's still
fun, the main rule is not to spoil it.

Please do not upload any unlawful content, don't try to keep weapons,
drugs, porn or anything similar on the platform. We're here to have
a nice conversation, administration reserves the right to kick any
user from the platform in case the decision is made that this user
does not behave well.

Don't try to DDOS us, don't try to hack us, be nice!
